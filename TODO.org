** Infix syntax

   Parse to full application, understand fixity declarations, parse
   with precedence to disambiguate applications.

   Use exact rationals for precedence, not integers!

** Tabled ~for~ syntax

   As a declaration form.

** Analysis to rule out inductive data types.

   Unless they turn out to be useful, in which case we will need to
   understand their semantics.
